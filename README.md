This is our capstone project for Codeup. It's a website built on HTML/CSS, JS (Heavy React), PHP (larvel), MySQL and uses the Google API for the map. 

In short, it allows user to upload photo or choose a random photo. The backend extracts the EXIF data and plots the photo on the map; with additional information.

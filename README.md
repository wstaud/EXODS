#EXIF Map Capstone Project

This is our capstone project for Codeup. It's a website built on HTML/CSS, JS (Heavy React), PHP (larvel), MySQL and uses the Google API for the map. 

In short, it allows user to upload photo or choose random photo. The backend extracts the EXIF data and plots the photo on the map; with additional information.
